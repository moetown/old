			<h1>First of all</h1>
			<p>I want to make exceptional design. This most likely speaks for itself to you, knowing that I am a designer. And who wouldn't prefer a outstanding mindful design to a poorly thought through one?</p>
			<blockquote>To me design has a lot to do with empathy. Which I think is the key to creating the best designs. Empathy is the ability to associate with your users, to visualize their experiences, to listen to their stories, and to be able to incorporate their behaviour in the design.</blockquote>
	
			<p>To understand human behavior we as designers has to become a hollow shell when it comes to our users - really soaking in their experience without incorporating our own mental models. It's a creative and educational process of being open to anything to be able to create
			the best possible design. </p>

			<h1>I like crafts</h1>
			<p>And what kind of craft you might ask yourself. To me, that doesn't matter all that much, I can play on most things. As long as I can create, elaborate and express. It could be digital media. It could be carpentry. It could be music. It could be cooking. I do all of that, and it fires up my neurons in most exciting ways. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
			<h1>Dishes from Mars</h1>
			<p>Yes, there's quite the few of us out there who goes extremely busy when the dish pile starts to go Everest-like in the zink. No matter how much we look away, it grows at the speed of Moores law. Especially if we like to eat (and yes - we do!). Some people dream of owning a Ferrari. I dream of owning a dishwasher.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.2s">
			<h1>People </h1>
			<p>I am constantly looking for awesome team environments. Allthough I am good at making use of time by myself it's so much more fulfilling together with others. There are a few things I try to keep in mind. We all like to be heard, to be encouraged and most important have fun. </p>

			<h1>Downunder</h1>
			<p>There was a few reasons to moving to Australia. I had a job back in Sweden that didn't have much of a creative side. I also wanted to test my wings and continue my digital design journey. Australia has some amazing tech. That makes a good fit in my eyes. I also met this quite extraordinary man from Oregon, which made it hard to continue to live in Sweden due to our countries rediculous immigration legislations and our extreme spendings
			on flight tickets. So we said to ourselves: lets be together somewhere else and we'll figure it out. Said and done, we now live on the Sunshine Coast.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-6 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.6s">
			<h1>Why?</h1>
			<p>As a designer we're often taught to continiously ask our users "why?" until we reveal the true reason to why something is not functioning to the extent it was intended. As an analytical human being I really like the idea of that. Often when we ask ourselves why, for instance "Why am I rewriting this post for the fifth time?" it can reveal things about ourselves and others that we were not expecting to find. In my case, I rewrote this five times
		because I just so desperately want it to make sense. But also because I just like writing in general. Knowing real agendas provides opportunities of creating richer and meaningful experiences.</div>
