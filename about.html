			<h1>First of all</h1>
			<p>I want to make exceptional design. This most likely speaks for itself knowing that I am a designer. And I mean who wouldn't prefer a outstanding mindful design to a poorly thought through one?</p>
			<blockquote>Looking through my lense, design has a lot to do with empathy.  Empathy is the ability to associate with your users, to visualize their experiences, to listen to their stories, and to be able to incorporate their behaviour in the design.</blockquote>
            <p>Why is that important? It's important because people are social beings, wanting to learn from eachother, create things that matter and with a huge impact on eachother. Maybe more so now than ever our social interactions affect our lives on a daily basis and we brand ourselves in unique ways. What an exciting time to be alive!</p>

			<h1>I like crafts</h1>
			<p>And what kind of craft? To me, that doesn't matter as much. It is more about the creative freedom and expressive ability. It could be digital media. It could be carpentry. It could be music. It could be cooking. Exploring different experiences with anything is to me a great enjoyment </p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
			<h1>Dishes from Mars</h1>
			<p>Yes, there's quite the few of us out there who goes extremely busy when the dish pile starts to go Everest-like in the zink. No matter how much we look away, it grows at the speed of Moores law. Especially if we like to eat (which most of us do). Some people dream of owning a Ferrari. I dream of owning a dishwasher. I am starting to think my partner does too. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-4 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.2s">
			<h1>People </h1>
			<p>I am constantly looking for awesome team environments. Allthough I am good at making use of time by myself it's so much more fulfilling together with others. I have had various sales roles where the team was always the core value in reaching sucessful results, empowering eachother to be our best selves.</p>

			<h1>Downunder</h1>
			<p>There was a few reasons why we moved to Australia. I had a job back in Sweden that didn't have much of a creative side. I also wanted to test my wings and continue my digital design journey. Australia has some amazing tech. That makes a good fit in my eyes. I also met this quite extraordinary man from Oregon. It sure made it hard to continue to live in Sweden - our countries have rediculous immigration legislations and we ended up spending crazy sums
			on flight tickets (allthough it was well spent). One day we were just talking about how to solve our issue we realised we both had been wanting to move to Australia in our lives at some point. A seed was created, six months later we made it grow. </p>

		<div class="wow fadeInUp col-md-6 col-sm-6" data-wow-delay="1.6s">
			<h1>Why?</h1>
			<p>As a designer we're often taught to continiously ask our users "why?" until we reveal the true reason to why something is not working for our users. It can be a function of a digital service, a product, yeah basically anything that causes a non-pleasant experience. As an analytical human being I really like the idea of asking why. Often when we ask ourselves why, for instance "Why am I rewriting this post for the fifth time?" it can reveal things about ourselves and others that we were not expecting to find. In my case, I rewrote this five times because I just so desperately want it to make sense. But also because I just like writing in general. </div>
